# Josh Chang â€“ About Me!

Hi, I'm Josh! I'm originally from Irvington, NY, and I'm currently a sophomore studying computer science at Yale University. I've been coding since I was a little kid, and it's one of my favorite things to do; there is something so magical about solving problems and creating cool stuff. My other hobbies/interests include meteorology (especially snow!), geology, and hiking.

My main area of expertise is definitely web development. I started learning JavaScript when I was nine years old, and in the decade since I have gotten pretty familiar with the language and ecosystem surrounding it. I love TypeScript, and am profficient with tools like React, Vue, NodeJS, Express, Next, Nuxt, Astro, Qwik, Solid, and Tailwind, as well as Web Standards and APIs.

I also like graphic design, and I try to apply that to my websites. I guess I'm one of the few people who actually enjoys CSS.

The main projects I'm working on right now are:
- Building a new content management system from scratch for the Yale Daily News
- Experimenting with machine learning weather prediction using satellite data

Most of the public repos on my GitHub are from high school, and a bunch of them are broken, but feel free to take a peak around!

I'm always open to freelance work, so get in touch at [joshchang04@gmail.com](mailto:joshchang04@gmail.com) if you have an idea or just want to say hi :)

Giraffes are my favorite animal, followed closely by sea turtles.

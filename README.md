# Josh Chang â€“ About Me!

Hi, I'm Josh! I'm originally from Irvington, NY, and I'm currently a rising senior studying Computer Science and Earth & Planetary Sciences at Yale University. I've been coding since I was nine, and it's one of my favorite things to do; there is something so magical about solving problems and creating cool stuff. I currently work at a startup building the future of payments. My other hobbies/interests include meteorology, hiking, and climbing.

Many of the public repos on my GitHub are little side projects from over the years, and most are pretty messy.

# Josh Chang

Hi, my name is Josh, and I am currently a freshman studying computer science at Yale University, although I'm originally from Irvington, New York. I've been coding since I was a little kid, and it's one of my favorite things to do. There is something so magical about solving problems and creating cool stuff.

My main area of expertise is web development. I've literally been writing JavaScript since I was nine years old, so I'm proffecient with a bunch of different tools, like React.js, Vue.js, Vite, NPM (although I currently prefer PNPM), Node.js (I'm excited for Bun), Next.js, Nuxt, Astro, Solid.js (my personal favorite UI framework at the moment), p5.js, Google Apps Script (a hidden gem for hobby projects), and jQuery, as well as just plain old JavaScript/TypeScript. I've played around a little with Svelte, but I want to try it in ernest soon. For the backend, I usually use Vercel to host my websites, and Firebase/GCP for everything else (auth, database, etc.).

I also like graphic design, and I try to apply that to my websites. I guess I'm one of the few people who actually enjoys CSS, usually in the form of Tailwind now-a-days.

The main projects I'm working on right now are:
- A website and custom CMS for the Yale Outdoors club (using Astro and Solid.js)
- A whole new CMS for the Yale Daily News (using React and Next.js)

Most of the repos on my GitHub are from high school, and a bunch of them are broken, but feel free to take a peak around.

# Josh Chang â€“ About Me!

Hi, I'm Josh! I'm originally from Irvington, NY, and I'm currently a junior studying Computer Science and Earth & Planetary Sciences at Yale University. I've been coding since I was nine, and it's one of my favorite things to do; there is something so magical about solving problems and creating cool stuff. My other hobbies/interests include meteorology, hiking, and climbing.

Most of the public repos on my GitHub are from high school, and a bunch of them are broken.

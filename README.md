# Josh Chang â€“ About Me!

Hi, my name is Josh. I'm originally from Irvington, NY, and I'm currently a freshman studying computer science at Yale University. I've been coding since I was a little kid, and it's one of my favorite things to do; there is something so magical about solving problems and creating cool stuff. My other hobbies/interests are geology and meteorology (especially snow!).

My main area of expertise is definitely web development. I've literally been writing JavaScript since I was nine years old, so I'm proffecient with a bunch of different tools, like React.js, Vue.js, Node.js (I'm excited for Bun), Next.js, Nuxt, Astro, Solid.js (my personal favorite UI framework at the moment), p5.js, and Google Apps Script (a hidden gem for hobby projects), as well as just plain old JavaScript/TypeScript.

I also like graphic design, and I try to apply that to my websites. I guess I'm one of the few people who actually enjoys CSS, usually in the form of Tailwind nowadays.

The main projects I'm working on right now are:
- A website and CMS for the Yale Outdoors club (using Astro and Solid.js)
- A whole new custom CMS for the Yale Daily News (using React and Next.js)

Most of the repos on my GitHub are from high school, and a bunch of them are broken, but feel free to take a peak around!
